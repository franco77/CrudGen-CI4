**Preparation before using this Codeigniter 4 CRUD Generator (Important) :**

*   On **Controller** `app/Controller/BaseController.php`, load database library, session library and url helper
    *   `protected $helpers = ['html','text','form','session'];`

    *   database.default.hostname = localhost
    *   database.default.database = database
    *   database.default.username = username
    *   database.default.password = password
    *   database.default.DBDriver = MySQLi

**Note:** If you get an error when connecting to the database I recommend removing this line of code from the file `.env`  
`# If you use MySQLi as tests, first update the values of Config\Database::$tests.`
